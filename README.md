# MAC Address Changer
The term MAC address is an acronym for Media Access Control Address. The MAC Address refers to a unique identifier that gets assigned to a Network Interface Card/ Controller (NIC). It has a 64-bit or 48-bit address linked and connected to the concerned network adapter. The MAC Address can exist in a hexadecimal format. This type of address exists in six separate sets of two characters/ digits â€“ separated from each other using colons.


# Why to change MAC Address?
Changing the assigned MAC address may allow the user to bypass access control lists on servers or routers, either hiding a computer on a network or allowing it to impersonate another network device.
